Fork the project, hack away, push your changes and send me a pull request. DONE.\r\n2. Know your way around git but not signed up to GitHub? Clone the project (git clone git://github.com/awendt/PROJECT.git), hack away and send me a patch.\r\n3. If you don't know anything about git, click the \"Download Source\" located on every project page, choose your flavor (ZIP or TAR) and hack away. Send me an e-mail when you're done and we'll find a way.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
